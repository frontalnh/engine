## Component Initialization

![init scenario](../doc/images/P2PComponentInitializationScenario.png)

Above image shows how p2p component initializes

follows steps below

1. create node and save it in repository
2. set itself as leader

## Synchronization of peer table and leader

![Synchronization Of Peer Table And Leader](../doc/images/SynchronizationOfPeerTableAndLeader.png)

Above image shows how specific node connect to other whole nodes and have genuine Leader.

follows steps below

1. save node in peer repository when `ConnectionCreatedEvent` occurs
2. receive peer table
3. set connected node's leader as leader if connected node has more node list
4. check node list recursively until there are no more unconnected node and dial to unconnected node

## Leader election when leader node is disconnected

<p align="center"><img src="../doc/images/NodeDisconnectedScenario.png" width="450px"></p>

1. Check if disconnected node is a leader when `ConnectionDisconnectedEvent` occurs
2. elect leader


## General node Disconnected Scenario
<p align="center"><img src="../doc/images/NodeDisconnectedScenario.png" width="450px"></p>

1. receive `ConnectionDisconnectedEvent`
2. save `NodeDeletedEvent`


# Message Protocols
the message is intermediary that is required in grpc communication. and their protocol clarifies the main purpose of messages. below is the list of message protocols and their purposes. 

### PLTableDeliverProtocol
deliver peer leader table to other peers

### RequestVoteProtocol
request other peers to vote

### VoteLeaderProtocol
vote peer as leader

### UpdateLeaderProtocol
update peer's leader
